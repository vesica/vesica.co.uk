            <p>
                We started our journey in 2012 as a software company for museum and heritage collections.

            <p>
                Since then we've moved on to several different businesses and consulting operations, and in the process
                have worked with some of the UK's biggest brands, including Panasonic, O2, Open University, giffgaff and 
                MasterCard.

                But our cores values of Knowledge and Tradition permeate whatever work we do - whether it's hosting exhibitions,
                publishing books or building software, we believe that it serves no purpose unless it can do greater good and make 
                us realize why we are here, rather than making us forget about it.
